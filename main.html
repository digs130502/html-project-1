            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>I began by drawing shapes such as squares, rectangles, circles and triangles. Then i moved on to cubes, pyramids, and spheres. Cubes, predictavely, are not hard to do since their shapes aren't hard
                but it was still hard to do the spheres.
                It's ok though, I will keep on pressing on!!!

            <h2>Day 2</h2>
            <p>This day I moved on to shadows. I really want to get a sphere working and trying to get the shadows but it is hard right now. 
                I do not know how to imagine a shadow, let alone a light source, but I'll keep on pressing on.
